    question: "How do we get started?",
    answer:
      "Send through a few details about your garden and we’ll book a site visit. Giles will walk the space with you, chat through ideas, and outline the next steps.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you charge for quotes?",
    answer:
      "Initial conversations and itemised quotes are free within Nelson and most Tasman suburbs. Larger design packages are priced transparently before we begin.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work with our existing plans?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We can price directly from your designer’s drawings or collaborate to refine practical details before construction.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you organise subtrades such as electricians or plumbers?",
    answer:
      "Yes—after 40 years in the region we have reliable subtrades we trust. We can coordinate lighting, drainage, and other specialists as part of the job.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer ongoing maintenance?",
    answer:
      "We provide seasonal tidy-ups, pruning, feeding, and lawn care to keep everything looking sharp long after the build is complete.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which areas do you work in?",
    answer:
      "Nelson City, Stoke, Richmond, Brightwater, Mapua, Atawhai, Hira, and most of Tasman. Ask if you’re further afield—we’ll let you know what’s possible.",
  },
  {
    question: "How far ahead do we need to book?",
    answer:
      "Lead times change with the seasons, but most projects are scheduled 4–8 weeks out. We’ll give you realistic timeframes upfront.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does a typical project cost?",
    answer:
      "Every site is different, so we provide clear, itemised quotes outlining labour, materials, and allowances so you can make informed decisions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with smaller jobs?",
    answer:
      "Yes. From reviving a single courtyard to installing ready-lawn, we take on projects of all sizes if we’re the right fit.",
  },
